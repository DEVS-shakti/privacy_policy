  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> August 9, 2025</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to <strong>SMS API APP</strong>. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your information when you use our mobile application (<code>com.shakti.smsreader</code>). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency regarding the data we access, use, and safeguard.
  </p>

  <h2>What information we access</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>SMS (Transactional):</strong> If you grant SMS permissions, the app reads only transactional bank/UPI SMS messages to surface transaction alerts in one place. We do <em>not</em> access personal or non-transactional messages intentionally.</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> If you enable Notification Access, the app reads notifications (title & text) to detect transaction alerts from banks, wallets, and UPI apps.</li>
    <li><strong>Device & App Info:</strong> Basic device identifiers (app version, Android version) for debugging and analytics when you explicitly enable them.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why we need these permissions</h2>
  <p>
    The permissions are used solely to extract transaction-related information so you can view all transaction alerts in a single view inside the app. We do not require these permissions to perform unrelated functions.
  </p>

  <h2>Data storage & sharing</h2>
  <p>
    All processing is performed locally on your device unless you explicitly choose to export or backup data. We do not upload, sell, or share your SMS or notification content with third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-party services</h2>
  <p>
    We do not call external servers with SMS or notification content. If you enable optional features that use the internet (e.g., cloud backup, crash reporting), we will list them and request additional consent.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable steps to protect information stored within the app. However, no method of storage or transmission over the internet is 100% secure.
  </p>

  <h2>Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can choose not to grant SMS or Notification permissions. Without them, the app cannot extract transaction alerts automatically.</li>
    <li>You can revoke notification or SMS permission from Android Settings at any time.</li>
    <li>If you are required by Google to make the app the default SMS app for reading SMS, we will clearly inform you and only request the change when necessary.</li>
  </ul>
